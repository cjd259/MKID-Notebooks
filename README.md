# MKID-Notebooks

I'll be adding a few interesting notebooks relevant to MKIDs and their readout, which may interest other people. The first one is all about resonators and S-parameters and the like. If you want to mess around with the interacts, which is really the best part, then you'll just want to download all the files in a given folder and run the notebook.
